Project StepOne -  Join StepOne to create a healthier world.

StepOne is a startup organization collective of technology and healthcare professionals, volunteering with an aim to better prepare our community for future health emergencies. 

Idea Description: 
A non-profit organisation called Project StepOne was founded by tech and medical experts with the goal of better preparing our society for potential medical emergencies. In the event of an emergency, StepOne quickly scales up "always on" systems. Since March 2020, Project StepOne has actively collaborated with state and local governments to combat Covid by providing free telemedicine and other interventions to reduce mortality and morbidity. 
The application creates different enterprise admins, where each admin has an organization. System admin can create multiple networks and enterprises. Under system organization we can register or login three roles: volunteers, patients and drivers. With the volunteerâ€™s user id and password, NGO will provide services and allocate to them. Patients login with their credentials and ask for help. Patients will come under the doctors. Driver comes under transport organization where each employee has user id and password and they provide transport service. Transport organization will come under NGO. Doctor will work when only patient needs the service. Donor comes under NGO enterprise. Executive organization comes under government enterprise which they can view the statistics. Manager and supervisor comes under StepOne enterprise. Their role is to approve requests.

We have worked on 5 enterprises namely : 1. StepOne, 2. Government, 3. School, 4. NGO, 5. Hospital.

We have worked on 8 orgaizations namely:  1. Volunteer, 2. Seeker, 3. Transport, 4. Donor, 5. Supervisor, 6. Executive, 7. Admin, 8. Doctor.

A system admin logs in the system and manages or creates network in which the organization can operate, create new enterprises and create new services. 

Each enterprise admin can create employees under their respective organization. Each employee in all organizations will be provided their login credentials.

On the main screen there are three roles with which a random person can try to register themselves i.e., Patient, Doctor, Volunteer.

A patient can raise for a service in thier prefferd locality for volunteers and can also send their data to the doctor if they ant to get some input.
A  patient can also give feedback to the volunteer if they have completed a request depending on the type of service provided. 

A volunteer can login and assign raised requests to them and can also demand for transportation. 

A driver can login and approve or decline a trnsportation requst raised by a volunteer. 

A donor is registered under NGO enterprise and donor orgaization. They can login and donate financially to the organization. Also, they can view previous donations made by them.

A supervisor and manager can approve the registration requests raised by volunteer. 

An executive role is the one which looks at all the analytics of the network. Pie charts and graphs are also used for visually defining the statistics.
